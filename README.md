# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
Credit Card Default Prediction

Predicting whether a customer will default on their credit card payment using Machine Learning.
This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model building to evaluate risk factors behind credit card defaults.

# Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset
Size: 30,000 records × 25 features
Target Variable: defaulted (1 = Default, 0 = No Default)

# Features include:
Demographics: Age, Gender, Education, Marriage status
Financial: Credit Limit, Bill Statement (last 6 months), Repayment Status (last 6 months), Payment Amounts

# Project Workflow
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handling missing values and anomalies
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution of defaults vs non-defaults
Impact of age, education, and credit limit
Correlation between repayment history & default

# Feature Engineering
Creating repayment trend features
Analyzing delayed payments
Modeling
Applied multiple ML algorithms:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1-score
